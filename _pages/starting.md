# Getting Started - Overview

Welcome! If you are a developer who wants to learn how to develop with Stratis, we've done our best to make a site that will teach you how to get started.

Take a look at a list of blockchain topics: 


We have step by step instructions for how to create your first sample applications. We also show some more advanced coding tasks. However, the Stratis Development Foundation is a community - To really get the most out of it, we ask you to give feedback, ask questions, and even contribute articles and code when you have built something useful.

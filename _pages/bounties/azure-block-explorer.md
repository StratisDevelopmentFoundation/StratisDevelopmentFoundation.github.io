# Setting up an Azure block explorer

This article will show you how to set up a block explorer for the Stratis blockchain running on Azure. This provides you a source you can trust for information about the blockchain, and can be used for certain light clients (mobile) and other applications.

## Clone Stratis block explorer repo

## set up azure account

## set up azure server

## deploy block explorer code to azure server

## test block explorer web interface

# Remaining tasks to complete this article

* Probably will have to communicate with Stratis official devs to figure out how to setup the block explorer. Looking at the stratis platform github, we can see there are some block explorer code that might be ready to go, but a quick chat with them should help get you started.
* Follow existing steps, increase clarity and add more specific steps
* Add screenshots

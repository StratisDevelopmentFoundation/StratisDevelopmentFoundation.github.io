# End to end blockchain web application
## Overview
Here at the Stratis development foundation…
We are working to increase the community of developers building applications on the Stratis blockchain.
The barrier of entry to developing an end to end blockchain application is high. 
A developer must poses full stack coding, security, and blockchain technology skills. 
We are planning to lower this barrier by providing developers with an end to end infrastructure template:
    Secure full node
    Web server for users
    Back end data storage 
    
We're creating a simple application to showcase the template. 
    It will use smart contracts for a simple case (that we will discuss in the discord)
    By modifying or replacing the application, developers can make something new and useful. 
    The infrastructure decisions are all ready made.
This is important because most of the creativity and uses of the blockchain happen at the application level, not the infrastructure and back end. 
By allowing developers to focus on the application level, developers can build something useful in a number of hours. 
This is a way we can grow the number of useful applications on the Stratis network to meet our goal of 1000 useful apps.

## Current Status
We are currently looking to engage the commmunity in the discord channel: #end2end-blockchain-application-template 
To determine the best path to take. 
We will be discussing topics from each component such as: 
Infrastructure:
What kind of stack should we use and why?
Blockchain explorer API
What features would be usefull in a blockchain explorer. 
Stratis Full Node
Best security practices
Application logic Web app (Address alias)
What should the focus of our sample app be? 
Application Smart contract (Alias app Smart contract)
How can we design the smart contract to best suit the application? 
Packaging 
How can we best package this application to make it easy for developers to change the application logic and make it their own.
